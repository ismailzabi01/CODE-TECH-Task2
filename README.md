OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
Overview of Linear Regression on Housing Prices Project
Objective: The goal of this project is to implement a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. We'll use a dataset like the Boston Housing dataset for training and evaluating the model.

1. Data Collection
Dataset: The Boston Housing dataset is commonly used for regression problems. It includes features such as the number of rooms, average age of homes, and distance to employment centers, among others.

Features:

Square Footage: The size of the house.
Number of Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house.
Location: This can be represented by various features such as distance to city centers, neighborhood classifications, etc.
2. Data Preprocessing
Loading the Dataset: Load the Boston Housing dataset or any other similar dataset.
Handling Missing Values: Check for and handle any missing values in the dataset.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize features to ensure they contribute equally to the model.
Feature Selection: Select relevant features for training the model.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Summarize the main characteristics of the dataset.
Correlation Analysis: Examine the relationships between features and the target variable (housing prices).
Visualizations: Create plots to visualize relationships between features and housing prices.
4. Model Implementation
Choosing a Model: Implement linear regression, which models the relationship between the target variable and one or more predictor variables.
Training the Model: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the linear regression model on the training data.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
5. Model Evaluation
Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance.
Residual Analysis: Analyze residuals (differences between actual and predicted values) to check for patterns or biases.
6. Optimization and Fine-tuning
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Feature Engineering: Experiment with different features and transformations to enhance the model.
7. Deployment and Visualization
Model Deployment: Prepare the model for deployment if needed (e.g., creating a web app or API).
Visualization: Create visualizations to present model results and insights. Plot predicted vs. actual values and other relevant graphs.
8. Documentation and Reporting
Documentation: Document the process, including data preprocessing steps, model implementation details, and evaluation results.
Reporting: Create a report or presentation summarizing the findings, model performance, and insights gained from the analysis.
Tools and Libraries
Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Dataset: Boston Housing dataset from sklearn.datasets or a similar dataset available in the public domain.
